# TonicTime

An tiny example application demonstrating refreshing page content with Phoenix Channels and server-side template rendering.

## Overview

For a thorough explanation of this project see my blog post:
[A Refreshing Tonic, Realtime Updates with Phoenix Channels](http://keyanp.com/a-refreshing-tonic-realtime-updates-with-phoenix-channels.html).

The demo is also running live at: http://demo.keyanp.com/time, but is less interesting than reading the blog post :)

## How to run

To run locally:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
